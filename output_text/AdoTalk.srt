1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Which party, please?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,200
We will..

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,300
I hear, this is the one that is friends of a Mokyo cinematographer.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,600
And he started to think that it would make me laugh at him.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,000
This Canadian folk are waiting for us to sleep.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Maybe.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,800
but...

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,340
Why'd you remember that?

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,000
If you were a part of the members' atmosphere...

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,400
But you recited a song, why would you expect this...

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,920
It's wonderful that you所 to a person with a great face...

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,100
or you 105 years ago

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,700
It's been 7 a month.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,020
After that I made ajinana.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,480
I don't have any eyes to use and it was useless in the cold Sur République.

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:14,860
I wanted to enjoy on social media and

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,240
face a lot of negative things.
